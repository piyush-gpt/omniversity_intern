## Deploying on Vercel

### Prerequisites

- A Vercel account: If you do not already have an account, visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account for easy integration.
- Your project on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket: Vercel integrates directly with these services.

### Step 1: Import Your Project to Vercel

1. **Log in to Vercel**: After signing in, you'll be taken to the Vercel dashboard.
2. **Import Project**: Click on the "Add New" button, then click on "project" and select the repository where your this website is stored.
3. **Configure Your Project**: During the import process, Vercel automatically detects that you are running a React application and sets up the build settings for you. Typically, no configuration changes are necessary unless your project has specific build requirements.
   - **Build Command**: This is usually detected and filled out by Vercel. For a typical Create React App, it will use `npm run build`.
   - **Output Directory**: For a Create React App, this should be `build`.
   - **Environment Variables**: Set any necessary environment variables your application might need to run.
4. **Deploy**: After configuring your settings, click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will begin the deployment process, cloning your repository and building your project based on the settings provided.

### Step 2: Automatic Deployment on Push

- Every push to your repository (to branches like `main` or others you specify) will trigger a new deployment automatically.
- Vercel provides a unique URL for each deployment, as well as a consistent production URL.


### Step 3: Visit Your Deployed Application

- Visit the provided `.vercel.app` domain to see your live application.

### Additional Information

- **Vercel Documentation**: For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).
- **Manage Deployments**: View deployment history, revert to previous versions, and manage your live application directly from your Vercel dashboard.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can deploy and manage your "Contact Us" form application on Vercel, allowing it to be accessed worldwide with minimal setup. This process enhances your projectâ€™s visibility and accessibility, making it available to a broader audience.
